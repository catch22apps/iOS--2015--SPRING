# Homework 23

## Group Project - App Design/Planning

After splitting into two groups, work to create a design/plan-of-attack to create a cloud-backed app that will allow a group of users to answer quiz questions that are either multiple choice or short fill-in. DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE, only work on the data model, scaffolding for the structure of the app and UI layout design.

The groups are as follows:

#### Group A
* Randall
* Jim
* Keaton

#### Group B
* Jordan
* Richard
* Joe
