# Homework 13

## In Due Time - Part 1

Make a todo list application. Be sure to allow the user to enter a todo item description and also allow for items to be checked off. Todo item cells should also be deletable, but only if they are completed. Read this section of the UITableView Apple documentation to learn how to remove cells from a tableview.

Bonus points for allowing for the user to enter a due date for a given todo item.

[UITableView Class Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableView_Class/index.html)
* Be sure to look at the paragraph near the top that starts "When sent a setEditing:animated: message..." for information about allowing for deletion of cells.

[UITableView DataSource Protocol Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITableViewDataSource_Protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/UITableViewDataSource)
* Also look at the section here that is called "Inserting or Deleting Rows"
