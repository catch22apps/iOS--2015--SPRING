## Calculator

Create a single view application that shows a calculator interface. It should have buttons for numbers 0 - 9 (plus a . button so you can add floating point numbers) as well as 7 operator buttons (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equals, plus/minus, percent). It should also have a button to clear out the current transaction (clear). It will need a label to display the current value of the calculator. It should operate as you would expect from a normal calculator.
