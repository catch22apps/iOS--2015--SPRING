# Homework 10

## CalculatorBrain Library

Create a static library of the CalculatorBrain class you created and used in the Calculator homework assignment. If you don't yet have all your business logic in the brain class, be sure to move the logic and test it in the Calculator before you export the class for use in this library.

We will be using the brain class in hw 11.

### Steps to Success

* [ ] Ensure all business logic code for the calculations is happening in your CalculatorBrain class. Use the calculator app to test.
* [ ] Copy the contents or the whole files into the CalculatorBrain static library project we created in class.
* [ ] Build the CalculatorBrain project for use on an iOS device (not a simulator).
