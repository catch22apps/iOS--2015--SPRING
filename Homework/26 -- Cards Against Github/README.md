## Cards Against Github

Create an app that uses a UICollectionView to display user cards of Github users added by searching for their username. Display at least:
* Real name
* Username
* Avatar image
* Number of repos
* Followers
* Following
* Any other statistical information that would be useful.

When the user card is tapped, present a detail view with all of the above info, plus any additional detail info that would be useful.
