# Homework 24

## Group Project - Implementation

Using the plan/design from hw 23, implement a Quiz app using Firebase as a backend. We will NOT be able to complete every feature of this app, but a reasonable 1.0/MVP should be possible in the time allotted.

The groups are as follows:

#### The Iron Quiz
* Randall
* Jim
* Keaton

#### SolQWiz
* Jordan
* Richard
* Joe
